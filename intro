Pre-talk questions:
    Install stuff before beginning... I'm going to talk intro while you guys download.
    1. Do you have tmux installed?
    2. Do you have ipython installed?

    3. Which of you have used tmux?
    4. Which of you have used ipython?



This is a two part class aimed at expanding a developer's toolset with both tmux and IPython.

Goal:
Today's goal is to inspire everyone to use at least one of these tools for daily computing needs.  In both parts of the class,  we will review what the tool does and how to use it.  Given that these two tools are interactive tools (hence the "I" in IPython), I hope to integrate lecture with tons of hands on activity.

We have a lot to do.  If a demo doesn't work, we should skip it and come back later

Asking Questions:
Ask!

Lastly,
    At 1:30 and 2:15, there are a lot of other talks.  Please feel free to leave if you want to attend those lectures also
